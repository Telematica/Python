# Language Specific Python Features

## Python is a case sensitive programming language.

## Here are naming conventions for Python identifiers:

### Python Class names start with an uppercase letter. All other identifiers start with a lowercase letter.

```python
class Person:
    def __init__(self):
        pass
```
### Starting an identifier with a single leading underscore indicates that the identifier is private identifier.

```python

```

### Starting an identifier with two leading underscores indicates a strongly private identifier.

```python

```


### If the identifier also ends with two trailing underscores, the identifier is a language-defined special name.

```python

```
